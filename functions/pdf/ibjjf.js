RULES BOOK

1 ARTICLE 1 - REFEREEING
1.1 Authority of Referee
1.1.1 The referee is the highest authority in a match.
1.1.2 The referee ruling on the result of each match is incontestable.
1.1.3 The ruling on the result of a match may only be changed under the following circumstances:
• If the score on the board has been misread;
• If the athlete declared winner submitted his/her opponent using an illegal hold previously unnoticed by the
referee.
• If the athlete has been disqualified erroneously for using a legitimate hold. In this case, if the match was
interrupted and the athlete disqualified prior to the athlete under attack tapping out, the match shall be restarted
at the center of the match area and the attacking athlete shall be awarded two points. In the event that the athlete
under attack should tap out prior to the interruption and disqualification, the athlete performing the hold shall be
declared the winner.
Obs: Subjective interpretations of the referee on the awarding of points, advantages or penalties will are final and
not subject to change.
1.1.4 To overturn the outcome of a match, the following conditions should be observed:
• The referee can consult the event’s director of refereeing, but the final decision as to whether to overturn or not
overturn a result is the referee’s to make;
• The director of refereeing should consult the event’s center table regarding how the bracket has progressed and
may only authorize the overturning of a result if the bracket has not progressed to the next stage. Results will not
be overturned if the awards for the bracket have already been granted.
1.2 Refereeing Format
1.2.1 The organizers of the tournament may opt to appoint three referees for a single match whenever they deem it
necessary.
• In this case, two corner referees shall be seated in chairs placed at opposing corners of the match area.
• The corner referees bear the same powers as the central referee – and all or any points, advantage points or
penalty points awarded must be confirmed by at least two of the three referees.
• Should there be a consensus between the corner referees and the central referee, the corner referees shall remain
seated in the chairs at the corners of the match area.
• Should there be a conflict of opinion with the central referee, the corner referees should stand up and signal for
points, advantage points or penalty points to be awarded or subtracted, using gestures predefined in this Rules Book.
• Should there be a discrepancy between all three referees on points to be awarded for the same move, the intermediary decision shall count.
Ex: When one referee awards a guard pass, the second awards an advantage point and the third asks that points
be subtracted, the advantage point shall be recorded on the scoreboard.
• If the referee decides to disqualify an athlete due to the athlete’s accumulation of four penalties (serious foul or
lack of combativeness), the referee will make the serious penalty gesture before stopping the fight. If at least one of
the side referees repeats the gesture, the referee’s decision is confirmed and he or she is authorized to stop the fight.

VERSION 6.0 2024©ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

• If the referee decides disqualify an athlete due to the athlete committing a severe foul, he will make the gesture
before stopping the fight. If at least one of the side referees repeats the gesture, the referee’s decision is confirmed and he or she is authorized to stop the fight.
• When a match ends with a draw in points, advantages and penalties, the central referee will place the two
athletes in their starting position (one to his left and one to his right). The referee will take two steps back and
make a gesture for the side referees to stand up. After the side referees are standing, the central referee will take
a step forward with his right leg. After he or she does so, all three referees raise either their right or left arm in the
air. This will signify the athlete each referee believes to be the winner. The central referee will then declare the
winner chosen by a majority of the referees.
1.2.2 When deemed necessary, the IBJJF will use two additional referees with access to video replay for the correction
of awarded points, advantages or penalties on the scoreboard.
• The correction of any points, advantages or penalties originally awarded by the central referee will only happen
in the event of agreement between the two additional referees with access to the video replay.
• After the two referee’s with access to the video replay, have reached an agreement on how to correctly adjust
the current score, they will communicate the decision via the radio system.
• The central and side referees cannot contest the decision reached by the two referee’s with access to the video
replay.
1.3 Referee Duties
1.3.1 It is a referee’s duty to summon the athletes into the match area to initiate the match.
1.3.2 It is a referee’s duty to do a final check to be sure requirements – such as attire, hygiene, etc. – are being met.
Should an athlete not meet any of the requirements, it is the referee’s duty to determine whether the requirement
can be met within a determined amount of time.
1.3.3 It is a referee’s duty to position the athletes in the match area prior to the match.
• Points awarded to the athlete on the referee’s right shall be signaled using the referee’s right arm, which is distinguished from the left arm by a green and yellow armband, indicating the points should be marked on the green and
yellow section of the scoreboard.
• Points awarded the athlete on the referee’s left shall be signaled using the referee’s left arm, which does not bear
an armband, and the points will be marked on the uncolored section of the scoreboard.
1.3.4 It is a referee’s duty to position the athletes according to the color of their gis.
• Should both athletes be wearing gis of the same color, the first athlete summoned shall be positioned on the
referee’s right and be provided a green and yellow belt for identification, to be worn in addition to the belt already
fastened around his/her waist.
• If one athlete is wearing a white Gi and the other is wearing a royal blue gi, the athlete in royal blue shall be
positioned on the referee’s right.
• If one athlete is wearing a black Gi and the other athlete is wearing a royal blue gi, the athlete in royal blue shall be

1.3.6

It is a referee’s duty to intervene in a match when he/she deems it necessary.
Obs: When the referee stops the fight for any reason, the athletes must maintain their current position to the best of
their ability.

1.3.7

It is a referee’s duty to make sure the athletes fulfill their obligation to compete within the combat area.
• When 2/3 of the athletes’ bodies are outside the combat area in a stabilized position on the ground, the referee
should stop the match and, noting the position of each athlete, restart the match at the center of the match area with
the athletes in positions identical to those they were in at the moment of stoppage.
• While standing, one of the athletes steps into the safety area (unless a takedown attempt has already been
initiated), or when 2/3 of the athletes’ bodies are outside the combat area during not-yet-stabilized ground fighting,
the referee shall interrupt the match and stand both athletes up in the center of the combat area.
• When an athlete has a submission hold in place in the outlying safety area, the referee should not interrupt the
match.
• When an athlete has a submission hold in place and the opponent defends by moving to outside the outlying safety
area, the referee should stop the match and restart the match at the center of the match area with the athletes
standing. In this case, when the referee deems it clearly apparent the athlete under attack initiated the movement
that led to exiting the match area, he/she shall signal for 2 (two) points to be added to the score of the athlete
performing the submission hold, as described in item 3.1.1.
• When one athlete takes his opponent to the outlying safety area while trying to stabilize a scoring position, the
referee shall wait, whenever possible, for an athlete to stabilize the position for 3 seconds before stopping the fight.
If this happens, the referee will give the points and then restart the fight in the center of the combat area.
• Points or advantages will be assessed for counting up until the safety area and any movements performed outside
the safety area will not be eligible for counting.
• When the fight exits the combat area due to the movement of an athlete attacking a submission in hold, the referee
will not mark two points after stopping the fight. Instead, the referee may give an advantage depending on the
proximity of the submission, while respecting the rules of advantages (Article 5th).

1.3.8

It is a duty of referees overseeing under-12-years-old-division matches to protect the athlete’s spinal column by
positioning themselves behind the child when lifted off the ground by the opponent, as in the case of a triangle or
closed guard.

1.3.9

It is a referee’s duty to signal every or any penalty, advantage or point scored by each athlete.

1.3.10 It is up to the referee to punish and disqualify athletes.
• When the situation envisaged in item 6.2.2 (V – When an athlete performs an unintentional movement that puts
their opponent in a penalizable position) arises and neither athlete has a submission in hold, the referee should stop
the fight and replace the athletes in regular position. The referee will then restart the fight, punishing the infractor.
• Whenever the situation depicted in picture 11 of item 6.2.3 (Single-leg with head on the outside) arises, by attempt
to takedown or any other move coming from the ground, with the athletes on they knees or with a sweep motion, the
referee shall act in the following way:
• For juveniles and younger divisions and white belts, the referee will stop the fight and restart the match with both
athletes standing. No penalties will be given to either athlete.
• For the other divisions the referee shall not interfere with the match.
1.3.11 It is a referee’s duty to summon medical staff to the match area.

3 ARTICLE 3 – POINTS SCORING
3.1 Points shall be awarded by the central referee of a match whenever an athlete stabilizes a position for
3 (three) seconds.
3.1.1 When the proper defensive counter for a submission hold results in exiting the match area, the referee shall
signal 2 (two) points be awarded to the athlete applying the submission hold (as addressed in item 1.3.7).
3.2 Matches should unfold as a progression of positions of technical control that ultimately result in a
submission hold. Therefore athletes who voluntarily relinquish a position, in order to again score points
using the same position for which points have already been awarded, shall not be awarded points upon
achieving the position again.
3.3 Athletes who arrive at a point-scoring position while caught in a submission hold shall only be awarded
points once they have freed themselves from the attack and stabilized the position for 3 (three) seconds.
3.3.1 Should an athlete achieve point-scoring positions while caught in a submission hold but only escapes the hold
once no longer in the point-scoring position, will not be awarded points or advantages for those positions.
3.3.2 The 3-second stabilization count for one or several point-scoring positions will be interrupted, when the opponent
lock in a submission hold during the count.
When this happens, the athlete will be awarded an advantage for each of the point-scoring positions achieved,
regardless of whether the opponent is no longer in the positions once the hold has been escaped from or regulation time has ended.
3.3.3 An athlete who reaches one or more positions (cumulative points) but is being attacked with a submission hold
by his/her opponent, shall only be awarded one advantage point if he/she does not escape the attack prior to the
end of the match.
3.4 Athletes shall be awarded cumulative points when they progress through a number of point-scoring
positions, as long as the three-second positional control from the final point-scoring position is a
continuation of the positional control from the point-scoring positions from earlier in the sequence. In this
case, the referee shall count only 3 (three) seconds of control at the end of the sequence before signaling
the points be scored.
Ex: Guard pass followed by mount shall add up 7 points (3+4).
3.5 When both athletes pull guard at the same time, the athlete who achieves top position first is awarded an
advantage point.
Obs: In cases that the athlete achieves the top position by going straight to the side-mount, he will not receive
points nor an advantage for the guard pass.

ARTICLE 4 – POINT SCORING POSITIONS

4.1 Takedown (2 points)

4.1.1 When one of the athletes, starting the movement with 2 feet on the ground, causes the opponent to land on his/
her back, sideways or seated, establishing top position for 3 (three) seconds.

4.1.2 When an athlete forces his/her opponent to the ground on all fours or belly-down, points shall only be awarded
once the athlete performing the takedown controls the opponent’s back without the requirement of placing hooks
and keeping at least one of the opponent’s knees on the ground for 3 (three) seconds.
4.1.3 If an athlete forces his or her opponent to the ground in the outlying safety area, the athlete performing the takedown should have both feet within the match area when the movement begins. In this case, if the athletes land in
a stabilized position, the referee will only stop the match after 3 seconds of stabilization in the position. Then the
referee will score the points and restart the match at the center of the match area. The athletes will be placed in
the same position they were in when the match was stopped.
4.1.4 In a sweep movement, when both athletes remain standing for less than 3 seconds and the athlete on defense
throws the opponent to the ground on their back or sideways, or on his knees and controlling the back, shall not
be awarded the two points or advantage for the takedown.
4.1.5 While in any position starting from guard, where the athletes remain on their feet for 3 seconds, the combat shall
then be considered standing combat.
Note: In order to start the 3-second countdown, one of the athletes must have two feet on the ground and the
opponent at least one foot on the ground without the knee of the opposite leg touching the mat.
4.1.6 When the opponent has one or two knees on the ground, the athlete performing the takedown will only be awarded points if he/she is standing at the moment the takedown is carried out, unless it is a sweep-defense situation,
as described in this article, and meets the 3-second stabilization-count criterion.
Note: No points shall be awarded in situations where the opponent is taken down from their knees, whether
initiated in the guard or any other ground-fighting situation.

VERSION 6.0 2024©ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

4.1.7 When the athlete forces his/her opponent to the ground using a single or double-leg takedown and the opponent
lands seated and successfully applies a counter-takedown (another takedown), only the athlete performing the
counter-takedown shall be awarded the two points when he/she can stabilize this position for 3 (three) seconds.
4.1.8 For any takedown technique where the athlete, delivering his/her opponent back-down or sideways on the
ground, lands in guard or half-guard and immediately suffers a successful sweep by the opponent, he/she shall
be awarded an advantage relating to the takedown and his/her opponent shall be awarded the two points from
the sweep.
4.1.9 An athlete who takes the opponent down in order to defend a standing back-take, where the opponent has
both hooks in place, or one hook in place and neither foot on the ground, will not be awarded the two points or
advantage for the takedown. Even after the position has been stabilized for three seconds.
4.1.10 An athlete who initiates a takedown before the opponent initiates the guard pull shall be awarded the two points
or advantage for the takedown, as described in item 4.1 (Takedown).
4.1.11 An athlete who initiates a takedown after the opponent initiates a guard-pull attempt shall not be awarded the
two points or advantage for the takedown.
4.1.12 When an athlete has a grip on the opponent’s pants and the opponent pulls guard, the athlete with the grip on
the pants shall be awarded two points for the takedown if he/she stabilizes the top position on the ground for 3
(three) seconds.
Note: If the opponent pulls closed guard and remains suspended in the air, the athlete will have to put the opponent’s back on the ground within 3 (three) seconds and stabilize the top position for 3 (three) seconds to be
awarded with Takedown points.
4.2 Guard Pass (3 points)
• When the athlete in top position manages to surmount the legs of the opponent in bottom position (pass guard
or half-guard) and maintain side-control or north-south position over him/her for 3 (three) seconds.

SIDE CONTROL

NORTH-SOUTH CONTROL

OPPONENT LYING ON HIS SIDE

Note 1: Guard is defined by the use of one or more legs to block the opponent from reaching side-control or northsouth position over the athlete on bottom.
Note 2: Half-guard is the guard where the athlete on bottom is lying on his/her back or side and has one of the
top-positioned athlete’s legs trapped, blocking him/her from achieving side- or north-south control over the
bottom-positioned athlete for 3 (three) seconds.
Note 3: The position of the top athlete’s legs determines whether it is half-guard or reverse half-guard, according to
the following examples:

VERSION 6.0 2024©ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

Example 1: In half-guard with his right leg
trapped, his left leg is positioned alongside the
right leg of the opponent playing guard.

Example 2: In reverse half-guard with his right
leg trapped, his left leg is positioned alongside
the left leg of the athlete playing guard.

• If while attacking from top position, such as an armbar, for example, the athlete ends up on bottom and does not
use his/her legs to prevent the opponent from reaching side-control, no points or advantages shall be awarded for
the guard pass, according to the definition of guard.

stabilization is achieved on the ground. The advantage shall only be awarded when there is no longer a possibility
of completing the takedown attempt, in accordance with items 3.4 and 5.5.
5.6.2 Advantage from Guard Pass
• When the athlete passing guard stacks the opponent, or allows the opponent to roll back his/herself, controlling
the opponent’s back in four-point-kneeling position and maintaining at least one knee on the ground, without

sequence, according to article 5.5.
5.7.2 The half-guard position shall not count for an advantage for the athlete on top if it did not originate from a guardpass attempt.
5.7.3 Athletes who suffer a takedown from the opponent and manage to roll to top position shall no longer be awarded
an advantage point by the referee.
5.7.4 The athlete who initiates a sweep movement, but deliberately gives up the top position in order to preserve a
defensive position, shall not be awarded an advantage for the sweep.
5.7.5
No advantages will be awarded for sweeps that start and end in a 50/50 guard situation.

TECHNICAL FOULS – ILLEGAL MOVES
19

Knee Reaping

Knee reaping is characterized by when one of the athletes places his thigh behind the leg of his opponent and
passes his calf on top of the opponent’s body above the knee, placing his foot beyond the vertical midline of the
opponent’s body and applying pressure on his opponents knee from the outside, through inside, while keeping
the foot of the leg at risk trapped between his hip and armpit.
It is not necessary for one of the athletes to hold the foot of his opponent in order for the foot to be considered
trapped.
For purposes of this rule, when one athlete is standing and bearing their weight on foot of the same leg as the
knee in danger, the foot will be considered trapped.
For Purple Belt Athletes and bellow
When the two athletes are seated with their legs crossed but in a legal position as illustrated by image 1,
and one of the athletes stands up, causing the opponent from below to be in an illegal position as illustrated
by image 2. This is because when standing up, the foot that was loose and now stepping on the ground is
considered a trapped foot.
In this situation, the referee must stop the fight, then place athlete B in a sitting position and athlete A standing
at a sufficient distance to allow new grips and then continue the fight.
If the situation shown in image 2 occurs
after a sweep, the referee must wait 3
seconds to define the stabilization, and
in sequence; stop the fight; award 2
points for athlete A who is on top, place
athlete B in a sitting position and athlete
A standing at a sufficient distance to
allow new grips and continue the fight.
For Brown and Black Belt athletes:
The referee will not interrupt the fight.
No penalty will be applied exclusively in
this case.
